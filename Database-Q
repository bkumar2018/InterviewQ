-- Create the dept table
CREATE TABLE dept (
    dept_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Create the emp table with dept_id as a foreign key referencing dept table
CREATE TABLE emp (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    emp_dept_id INT NOT NULL,
    -- Foreign key constraint
    CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept FOREIGN KEY (emp_dept_id) REFERENCES dept(dept_id)
);

dept_id in the dept table is defined as SERIAL, which means it will auto-increment.
dept_name is a VARCHAR field to store the department name.
In the emp table, emp_id is the primary key, also defined as SERIAL for auto-incrementing.
emp_name is a VARCHAR field to store the employee name.
emp_dept_id is an INT field to store the department ID of the employee.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint named fk_emp_dept is added to the emp_dept_id field, referencing the dept_id column in the dept table. This ensures referential integrity, meaning that every value in emp_dept_id must exist in the dept_id column of the dept table.

-- Insert data into dept table
INSERT INTO dept (dept_name) VALUES
    ('Human Resources'),
    ('Finance'),
    ('Marketing');

-- Insert data into emp table
INSERT INTO emp (emp_name, emp_dept_id) VALUES
    ('John Doe', 1),  -- John Doe works in Human Resources (dept_id = 1)
    ('Jane Smith', 2), -- Jane Smith works in Finance (dept_id = 2)
    ('Alice Johnson', 3); -- Alice Johnson works in Marketing (dept_id = 3)
